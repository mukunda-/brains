				<h2>What information are you gathering from me?</h2>
				<p>We don't gather any information aside from what you normally input into our forms.
				Google may harvest some anonymous information for their analytics database.</p>
				<h2>What will you use my email for if I sign up with one?</h2>
				<p>We only use your email if you need to reset your password, and 
				resetting your password is only possible if you use an email as your username.</p>
				<h2>Is my personal password safe with you?</h2>
				<p>Before your password is sent to us, it is hashed with a semi-secure method, 
				as to mask it from any secret agents listening to your network traffic. 
				When we receive it, it is hashed again using a highly secure method to store 
				it in our database.</p>
